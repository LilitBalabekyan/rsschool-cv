About me
--------

Good day, my name is Lilit. I have many goals, actually I'm living my life with "Goals and only goals".  
I'm just an HighSchool student and I haven't really done something special yet. As a "modern-person"  
I want to become a programmer. I studied for it for years. I'm attending TUMO Web Design Courses for now.

About future goals. Also I'm trying to work on my English to make it up to "C1" I have a lot of ideas about  
my own WebSites. I started designing a WebSite about mental health and how to deal with it. Also i want to  
create a webSite where people can help their anxiety! I know all this information can be not really impressive,  
but i'm trying my best!

Skills:
-------

*   HTML, CSS
*   JAVASCRIPT, PHP
*   Adobe Photoshop

Code example

### This example will take the index of the array as a value:

**var** a=[...Array(4)]   
**var** b=a.map((_,i)=>i)  
**var** c=[...Array(4)].map((_,i)=>i)  
**var** d=Array.prototype.map.call(a,(_,i)=>i)  
**console.log(a)** //output: [ undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined ]   **console.log(a)** //output: [ 0, 1, 2, 3 ]   **console.log(a)** //output: [ 0, 1, 2, 3 ]   **console.log(a)** //output: [ 0, 1, 2, 3 ]
